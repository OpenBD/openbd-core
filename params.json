{"name":"OpenBD","tagline":"The original open source Java powered GPL CFML runtime engine","body":"<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/OpenBD/openbd-core/blob/master/openBD_logo_788x150px.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nOpenBD is the worlds first truly open source and free GPLv3.0 Java CFML runtime.   OpenBD has a long legacy, first created in 2000.\r\n\r\n### Running OpenBD\r\n\r\nYou can run OpenBD quickly without all the hassle of setting and configuring a JEE server.   Use the [JettyDesktop launcher](https://github.com/aw20/jettydesktop) - instructions on use located at the [JettyDesktop Wiki](https://github.com/aw20/jettydesktop/wiki).   This will run the OpenBD WAR file easily and quickly.\r\n\r\n### Community Mailing List\r\n\r\nAn active Google Groups list can be found: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbluedragon\r\n\r\n### Building OpenBD\r\n\r\nYou will require the following tools to be able to build OpenBD from source:\r\n\r\n* Java Developers Kit Virtual Machine 8\r\n* Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nOptional, OpenBD source drop includes an Eclipse project to enable building and debugging under the Eclipse IDE (http://www.eclipse.org/).   All files required to build the core OpenBD JAR/WAR is contained within this GitHub project.\r\n\r\nAll the necessary scripts and resources are in the ./build/ folder.   The build.xml will build the core WAR file, the OpenBlueDragon.jar file as well as popping in the manual if you desire.\r\n\r\n* ant compile\r\n* ant war\r\n* ant war-with-manual\r\n\r\nIf you are just updating the core OpenBD JAR file in an already existing installation then 'ant compile' will create the file: ./build/targets/OpenBlueDragon.jar.   You can then drop this file over the top of an existing installation if you are say upgrading a minor update.  The ReleaseNotes.txt will indicate if a full /WEB-INF/lib/ folder update is required.\r\n\r\n'ant war' will build a standard JEE WAR file that can be dropped into any JEE application server, such as Jetty, Tomcat or JBoss.  'ant war-with-manual' will build the standard JEE war but will also pull in the latest 'openbd-manual' (https://github.com/OpenBD/openbd-manual) and add that as part of the distribution.\r\n\r\nAll output from the ant scripts will be in the /build/targets/\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
